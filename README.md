# About basicmathgen

This is just a small side project that I develop for my nephews and kids. Online basic math problem generators make you sign up and limit
you to certain options. I decided to write my own.

This project uses reportlab module for pdf generation.

## How To Use

Install the required package:

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

You can then run the .py file for a simple example to generate a problem set.
